        Hi! I'm a junior Frontend Developer with more than 10 years experience from working in restaurants and bars, at both small companies and at one of Swedens biggest coffee roasteries - which makes me used to handling stressful situations and knowing how important it is to work well with your team. Iâ€™m creative and solution oriented, always curious to understand how things work and how they can be improved. People describe me as calm and structured, which I believe is good characteristics for a Developer and this business.

        My favorite fields right now is ReactJS and JavaScript, and I really want to dig deeper in to that. I also have a goal to get more in to Design and UX, where I can use my creative skills to the fullest.
