        Hi! I'm a junior Frontend Developer with a background in the restaurantbusiness, where I've been working at small companies and at one of swedens biggest coffeeroasteries. The tasks have been everything from admin to customer service to hosting lectures and educating in specialty coffee. I'm a creative person that get energy from learning new things - righ now I'm all about ReactJS and want to develop within that area. People describe me as a calm, structured and practical person and I consider myself to be a quick learner. "Hands-on/learning-by-doing" is my favorite way of learning.
