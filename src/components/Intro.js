        Hi! I'm a junior Frontend Developer with a background in the restaurantbusiness. I've been working at both small,
        pretentious companies where I've been doing everything from admin to customer service and at one of swedens
        biggest
        coffeeroasteries with educating in specialty coffee. I'm a creative person that get energy from learning new
        things. People describe me as a calm, structured and practical person and I consider myself to be a quick learner.
        "Hands-on/learning-by-doing" is mostly how I face many
        problems.
